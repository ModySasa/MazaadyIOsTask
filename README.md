In this project , I have been using VIPER as an architecture.

To run the app, simply , open the code using xcode and run it on an emulator.

No assumbtions made.

There is Image cashing in the app.

Used my made MSConnection library to make the server calls to get the data.
Here is the link for it: https://github.com/ModySasa/MSConnectionLib.

My suggestion for later is to Use SwiftUI , and not UIKit as it is the future.
